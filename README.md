# Resources-
Just a collection of books/textbooks for further reading

For now, this compliation would be markets-focused. My recommended option to reading this series of books would be to learn first gain an understanding on both fundamental and technical analsysis. For fundamental analysis, study Economics and don't spend too much time on technical analysis. Just grasp the basics. 

My preferred flow would be focusing on different asset classes:

1. Forex
- https://www.babypips.com/
- FX Training Manual by Barclays

2. Fixed-Income
- The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities

3. Options
- Option volatility and pricing strategies: Sheldon Natenberg
- Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives: John C. Hull

4. Commodiites
- Commodities demysitfied

More advanced Books:

Interest Rate Models by Brigo and Mercurio
stochastic volatility models by Bergomi
